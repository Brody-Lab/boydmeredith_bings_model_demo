Installation
------------

To use the notebook, first clone the git repository. You can do this at the command line by typing 

.. code-block:: console

   $ git clone https://github.com/boydmeredith/bings_model_demo.git

If you have all the right dependencies, it should work out of the box.
If you want to recreate the environment, you can do that with the `environment.yml` file

Then run

.. code-block:: console

    $ jupyter notebook Bings\ Model\ Demo.ipyn

Checkout :doc:`source/modules` for a blank page that I need to add info to
